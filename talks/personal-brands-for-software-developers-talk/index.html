    <p>After long diligence, me and my old (Trantor) team decided to organize a meetup
to showcase our efforts, and to share our ideas with the local community. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Chandigarh-Programmers-Club/events/263862634/">The
meetup</a>
was organized in Trantor on September 18, 2019.</p>

<p>It was a collaborative talk given in 3 parts be me, Ayush Sharma, and Sheenam
Narula. Attendance was very low, but that&rsquo;s usually how it is in Tricity.
Overall it was a fun session with lengthy, and mostly fruitful discussions.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my set of slides from the talk:</p>
