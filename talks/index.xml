      <description>After long diligence, me and my old (Trantor) team decided to organize a meetup to showcase our efforts, and to share our ideas with the local community. The meetup was organized in Trantor on September 18, 2019.
It was a collaborative talk given in 3 parts be me, Ayush Sharma, and Sheenam Narula. Attendance was very low, but that&#39;s usually how it is in Tricity. Overall it was a fun session with lengthy, and mostly fruitful discussions.</description>

      <description>I gave this talk in one of internal sessions at Trantor. Goal was to acquaint one of our software teams into the world of application security. This was a basic talk, just to familiarize attendees with basic information security concepts. I leveraged this opportunity to propose setting up a Red Team in Trantor.
As practical part of this session, I created a docker based virtual lab with webgoat set up.</description>
