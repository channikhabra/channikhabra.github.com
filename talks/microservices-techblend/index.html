  <p>I recently joined a Whatsapp group named “Tech Blend”, which conduct weekly online meetups. Topic for last meetup was “Microservices”, for which I volunteered. Since I was working for around 2 years on a microservices based project of decent complexity, I thought it would be fun to talk about my experience.</p>
<p>The meetup was fun. I ran out of time. The meetup is quite well managed. Manpreet, the guy who organizes the meetup does a very good job respecting everyone’s time while managing to have meaningful discussions at the same time. Their topics/talks are usually quite shallow, but this event management is something I can learn from participating in this group.</p>
<p>Here are the slides for I created for the meetup. I was holding on to them hoping I’ll create a video, but that’s not happening. So I am just putting the slides over here.</p>
<p>Feel free to hit me up if you need some help regarding microservices, or if you need me to explain some slide, or just for a chat.</p>
