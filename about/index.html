    <p>I write software to make a living. I enjoy doing so. Both writing software and
making a living.</p>
<p>I also enjoy writing, giving talks and discussing engaging topics. Mostly
technical. This website has things I am willing to share publicly. You can go

resume</a>
as well.</p>
<p>I believe writing software is a lot more than just churning out code. Software
is incarnation of programmer&rsquo;s thoughts. Software is a way of life. The better
one know oneself, clearer (s)he can think, better (s)he can code. I see getting
better at life as a way of getting better at writing good software; and
vice-versa.</p>
<p>I enjoy learning new things, and have dabbled around multiple dimensions of
technology; e.g web/software development, penetration testing, reverse
engineering and IOT.</p>
<p>My life more or less revolves around computers and related stuff. I enjoy
thinking and thought exercises; writing software is one of my favorites.</p>
<p>I am open to take freelancing work. I have most experience in
Javascript/Typescript (both frontend and backend); but can also comfortably work
with Python, Golang, Haskell and Purescript.</p>
<p>This blog is a dumping ground for my thoughts.</p>
