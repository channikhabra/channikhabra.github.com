I write software to make a living. I enjoy doing so. Both writing software and
making a living.

I also enjoy writing, giving talks and discussing engaging topics. Mostly
technical. This website has things I am willing to share publicly. You can go
through my blog [posts](/blog "Blog"), [poems](/categories/poem "Poems"),
[projects](http://github.com/channikhabra/ "Github"),
[talks](https://slides.com/channikhabra "Slides.com"), or if you are considering
hiring a software architect, then [my
resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HFOxl97RGtuhAX95AhGWwa808SO9qSCYLjP1Pm39la0/edit)
as well.

I believe writing software is a lot more than just churning out code. Software
is incarnation of programmer's thoughts. Software is a way of life. The better
one know oneself, clearer (s)he can think, better (s)he can code. I see getting
better at life as a way of getting better at writing good software; and
vice-versa.

I enjoy learning new things, and have dabbled around multiple dimensions of
technology; e.g web/software development, penetration testing, reverse
engineering and IOT.

My life more or less revolves around computers and related stuff. I enjoy
thinking and thought exercises; writing software is one of my favorites.

I am open to take freelancing work. I have most experience in
Javascript/Typescript (both frontend and backend); but can also comfortably work
with Python, Golang, Haskell and Purescript.

This blog is an open journal in a way. Usually, I write here when I want to
- give my thoughts more structure than my personal journal approves
- share my thoughts with the world, as an act of shouting in the void
- use the act of making my thoughts public to attain solidifying
