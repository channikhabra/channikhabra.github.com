After long diligence, me and my old (Trantor) team decided to organize a meetup
to showcase our efforts, and to share our ideas with the local community. [The
meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Chandigarh-Programmers-Club/events/263862634/)
was organized in Trantor on September 18, 2019.

It was a collaborative talk given in 3 parts be me, Ayush Sharma, and Sheenam
Narula. Attendance was very low, but that's usually how it is in Tricity.
Overall it was a fun session with lengthy, and mostly fruitful discussions.

Here's my set of slides from the talk:
