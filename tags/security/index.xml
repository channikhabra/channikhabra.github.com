      <description>I gave this talk in one of internal sessions at Trantor. Goal was to acquaint one of our software teams into the world of application security. This was a basic talk, just to familiarize attendees with basic information security concepts. I leveraged this opportunity to propose setting up a Red Team in Trantor.
As practical part of this session, I created a docker based virtual lab with webgoat set up.</description>
