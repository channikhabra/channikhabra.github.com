      <description>I am thinking about doing a small series of posts on how I am managing the chaos that I am trying to stop fighting. I hope the chaos of an ADHD mind can be utilized rather than fought against. So far it has been working out pretty great (for past ~8 months). This post is about how I manage my ever exploding list of things I want to do.

      <description>One of the important aspects of living with ADHD is getting overwhelmed by thoughts. This is usually a major pain in the ass. When left unchecked it usually leads to a lot of confusion very painfully visible to people around you. This made most of my school life very tormenting. Despite being an &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; student, I was always completely lost.
This got better when I found computers. A book I found while sitting in the wrong classroom turned things around for me.</description>
