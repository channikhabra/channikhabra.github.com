      <description>It is near impossible for me to get something done if I don&amp;rsquo;t have 100% peaked interest in it at this very moment. Occasionally I can hyper focus on things, but that hyper focus rarely finish things. Hyper focus is like eating all the desert, leaving behind a plate full of broccoli.
I have noticed however that most of the times when I have actually finished something, I was, in my mind, helping someone else.</description>
