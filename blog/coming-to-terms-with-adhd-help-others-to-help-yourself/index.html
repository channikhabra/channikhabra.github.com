    <p>It is near impossible for me to get something done if I don&rsquo;t have 100% peaked
interest in it at <strong>this</strong> very moment. Occasionally I can hyper focus on things,
but that hyper focus rarely finish things. Hyper focus is like eating all the
desert, leaving behind a plate full of broccoli.</p>

<p>I have noticed however that most of the times when I have actually finished
something, I was, in my mind, helping someone else.</p>

<p>Reviewing the judicious documentation of my life, that is my journal, I can say
it for near about 100% of the things that I actually finished. The force behind
crossing the finishing line was either accountability, or my belief that someone
else is relying on me.</p>

<p>None of my own &ldquo;side projects&rdquo; have ever seen a ray of light, but most things I
started for others were finished. Mostly that was presentations, processes,
and very personally tailored learning materials.</p>

<p>Reviewing my journal, I noticed a pattern developing over the course of last
year. Whenever I had an idea that I wanted to see done, I tried to frame it in
somebody else&rsquo; canvas. If I could do that, I shared the idea with the person
and got them involved as a partner. Chances of success I&rsquo;ve observed were
directly proportional to how much I care for the person. Some of the things I
started that I couldn&rsquo;t fit in to help someone else are still in &ldquo;TODO&rdquo; state,
despite the long and clear road-maps I created for them.</p>

<p>This discovery of transforming emotions that come easily to me, into what I
believe I severely lack has sown seeds of new hope. Perhaps I will be able to
replace my need of accountability to get things done with this. I don&rsquo;t know if
it is vain need of acknowledgment, or goodness of heart, but it works.</p>

<p>I have started taking actions to optimize this. I am as anti-social as they
come, and that, now I believe, is a problem to be solved if I want to increase
my happiness.</p>

<p>Most of my activities with other people don&rsquo;t register to my brain as something
it should remember. My mind is often meeting people for first time despite
several previous encounters. That is the first thing I am going to tackle.
Concrete step I am taking for this, is to start using <a href="https://github.com/monicahq/monica/">Monica</a> to keep track of my
social life. Next step would be to actually start making effort to socialize. I
suppose saying &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to my colleagues every morning could be a good start.</p>
