    <p>Most of my school life I was very confused, depressed perhaps. I was a “good
boy”, as they call those traumatized, obedient kids. Confusion started turning
into frustration by the end of my 10th standard. It was the “board” class.
Nonsensical pressure, corporal punishment and stupid as fuck rules had started
turning my depression into anger. So much pressure was put on by that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117224135/http://channikhabra.github.io/2016/06/11/cost-of-being-a-rebel/sasacademy.com">bloody
shithole of a school</a> that one of my classmates had a mental breakdown. A guy
went complete nuts. That was the final nail in the coffin.</p>

<p>I felt like it was my turn next. So I rebelled. Against everything that didn’t
make sense to me. Unfortunate for me, one of the foes in my rebellion was
Mathematics. The dull, complex subject whose applications I couldn’t understand.
My teachers failed to convince me it was ever going to have a practical
application at all. All they could come up with was “competitive exams need it”.
But that won’t make the cut.</p>

<p>After a year of being a total brat, I finally pushed my parents to sell a cow
and buy me a computer. Computers always fascinated me, even though I had used
Computers only for a total of 10-12 hours max (occasional 15-20 minutes sittings
in IT lab). I taught myself Python from the ebooks I would download on my rare
visits to cyber-cafe in nearest city. It was a revelation. I didn’t need those
stupid teachers anymore; there was no need to go through all the frustration,
frowned looks and grudges (which often lead to physical punishment) from the
teachers. I could teach myself better, faster. Unfortunate side effect of this
realization: I didn’t need a shiny college.</p>

<p>Not going to college however was not an option. My parents were giving me enough
pain already for using computer too much (despite the fact that I was good at
school AND helped at home and farm as well). So I went for admission in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117224135/http://dgc.edu.in/">one of
those piece of shit colleges which let anyone in for a big some of money</a>.
Another story for another day.</p>

<p>I could teach myself everything I needed. I was perhaps right about that. But
there was nobody to tell me what to learn. By the time I got Internet I was
making enough side money building software to pay for my ever growing list of
re-appears. I didn’t see no math used anywhere. When I got Internet, I started
making websites. Again, no math to be seen anywhere. The college was as shitty
as they get. They never really taught any of the syllabus (DS, algorithms etc).
So I ignored them as mumbo-jumbo schools put in their books to make money. I was
making more money than most lecturers in that college, I didn’t care.</p>

<p>In 2014 I graduated, and went for full time freelancing. It took me some time
till I reached my limit; when I felt brute forcing my way through problems
wasn’t really efficient. It was boring. It was becoming more and more obvious
that I was plateauing. I started realizing that there are better ways to do
things, and so many of them have already been discovered.</p>

<p>But now the playtime was over. I was no longer in college, I had to support
myself; and my family (they’re not very good financially). So I continued
freelancing. It was paying much more than most approaching companies were
offering, clients were happy, so what the hell, I thought. I planned to save
some amount in bank, and then I was to take few months off to go back to square
one and learn CS theory and Mathemetics. I reached there 3 months ago. But then
life did what it always do. 2 big expenses came up and cleared most of my
savings. So I continued with freelancing.</p>

<p>But I guess it’s about time I put my original plan in action. I have started
getting the good ol’ limbo feeling again. I used to think it was my indiscipline
which make me feel like shit. But now I think it isn’t. Most of the time I have
to discipline myself to get away from the computer. When I start needing to
force myself to code, it’s because something somewhere is wrong. I think I’ve
hit another plateau (this realization (that it’s not indiscipline that put me in
limbo) itself was a load off my chest, but a story for another time).</p>

<p>I have savings to last for only a couple months without work, but I guess
that’ll have to do. It’s funny deja-vu situation actually. I was in similar
situation when I headed for Bangalore. Back to square one I guess. I think it’s
time to put a pause on freelancing, and pay the debt of my rebellion.</p>
