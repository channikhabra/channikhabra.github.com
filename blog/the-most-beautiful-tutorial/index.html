<p>The most beautiful tutorial I&rsquo;ve ever read, &ldquo;The Emacs-lisp Intro&rdquo;. Run your
Emacs and press &lsquo;C-h-i&rsquo;, and select &ldquo; Emacs Lisp Intro&rdquo; to read it. I am a
reader, and learner, I read a lot. I used to prefer learning from books, and
have a huge collection 70% of which I haven&rsquo;t even ever opened (and 95% I have
never completed). Most of my reads are related to programming, new languages,
techniques and frameworks. Over time my preference for learning programming
shifted from learning from books to learning from tutorials, documentation and
by reading the code itself. I found myself too fickle to stick with one long
book and keep myself interested in it. There is so much to explore in the world,
whenever I start reading a book, half way through I find something more
interesting. Something from the book, or hacker news, or reddit, or prismatic.
Mind is always successful in finding some sort of diversion. For a week ago, I
had not find any book or tutorial that could keep me with it till the end. And
then I met &lsquo;the Emacs-lisp intro&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s the most beautiful book (or tutorial, I
don&rsquo;t know what to call it) I have ever laid my eyes on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="perfect-flow">Perfect flow</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s more like a compilation of tutorials than a book, but it is so beautifully
organized. While reading it, it feels like it is orchestrated in the most
perfect way possible, to get the concepts settle in your mind, and not letting
you get bored at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="i-never-felt-like-lost-somewhere">I never felt like lost somewhere</h2>

<p>Being a mere mortal, many times when reading programming stuff I get lost in
between. Some topics that just don&rsquo;t enter my head, some things I can&rsquo;t grasp
sometime. Most tuts just get over with it leaving me in half despair. But this
one was very well laid out. I never had a feeling like missing something or
getting behind the author.</p>

<h2 id="it-held-my-hand-but-never-spoon-fed">It held my hand but never spoon fed</h2>

<p>Another beautiful thing. Easy tutorials most times are just too easy, their
easiness make them boring. I was working myself when reading this tutorial. It
was (little) challenging and very easy flow. Perfect for me.</p>

<h2 id="i-learned-to-praise-lisp-and-the-beauty-of-parenthesis">I learned to praise lisp and the beauty of parenthesis</h2>

<p>The perfect speed with which the things are put forward, and the clarity with
which it&rsquo;s done made me respect lisp much more. I learned so much about how lisp
works and how things are done in lisp world without even knowing I was learning
them.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-tried-learning-a-lisp--clojure--and-found-it-too-difficult-try-reading-this-tutorial">If you tried learning  a lisp (Clojure?) and found it too difficult, try reading this tutorial</h2>

<p>I tried learning Clojure few months back. I got a book and tried to study it. I
failed. There were so many things quite foreign to me, and I decided to put on
the shelf for future. That was the right decision. Reading this tutorial made
many things clear, and weird things respectable. I think now I am ready to give
Clojure another shot. Reading first few chapters of the same book (Programming
Clojure) was so much easier than before.</p>

<h2 id="using-anki-alongside-perfect-combination-for-producing-some-emacs-love">Using Anki alongside: perfect combination for producing some Emacs love</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Anki for spaced learning for a while now. I use it every time I
am reading something, it help me a lot to avoid re-reading books I left half way
(and then pick up later). Still it was a different experience using it while
reading this tutorial. So many ideas of doing stuff with Emacs were popping up
in my head while reading this tutorial, and thanks to Anki I reminded every
e-lisp function I encountered on the way, and this made me feel comfortable as I
knew their possible implementations, I knew what to use, and where to take
inspiration from.</p>

<h2 id="it-made-emacs-appear-so-simple-and-easy-and-powerful">It made Emacs appear so simple and easy, and powerful</h2>

<p>I have been using emacs for few months now (3 or 4 may be). I thought I knew it
just fine and that it&rsquo;s awesome but over-glorified. I was wrong. Emacs is
awesome indeed, but I didn&rsquo;t knew shit about it. And no one can tell you the
real glory of Emacs. It&rsquo;s a path one need to travel to know the feel. It has
changed many things in me as a programmer. For one thing, I now feel much more
controlled (and like secure in some way (&lsquo;cause of my psychotic issues may be))
when doing anything in Emacs.</p>

<h2 id="fill-your-mind-with-tons-of-ideas-things-you-want-your-editor-to-do-and-they-are-all-possible">Fill your mind with tons of ideas, things you want your editor to do, and they are all possible</h2>

<p>Emacs is known for its ability to customize, everyone know that. So did I. But
no, now I feel I really didn&rsquo;t know that. There is a whole world of
possibilities. There is so much one might desire from their editor and not even
know it. Now I realize so many things are wrong with my current setup, so many
new things I want Emacs to do. It&rsquo;s a very good feeling to have.</p>

<h2 id="it-was-a-bliss-reading-it-inside-the-emacs">It was a bliss reading it inside the Emacs</h2>

<p>I think it is the most important thing that made me feel so great about this
tutorial. Emacs dwarfs any awesome e-book reader I have ever tried. Not because
of navigation or any other fancy,but because I suddenly realized that right way
to read about programming is from inside my editor. Even a simple &lsquo;alt-tab&rsquo; is
too much. Almost all the cases where I would normally copy-paste the code to
check out something (I know copy-paste is a bad thing, but lazy me) were
replaced with a &lsquo;ctrl-e&rsquo;. I could execute the code right there inside the
tutorial, even parts of it. There are browser embedded consoles and stuff which
do the similar, but they can never match the experience Emacs gave.</p>
