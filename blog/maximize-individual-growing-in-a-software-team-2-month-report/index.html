<p>Couple months ago we started an <a href="https://channikhabra.github.io/blog/how-to-maximize-individual-growth-in-a-software-team/">initiative</a> in our team here at <a href="http://trantorinc.com/">Trantor</a> with the
focus on nurturing a culture which optimizes personal growth of an individual in
the team. I believe it is turning out to be quite successful. We decided we&rsquo;ll
focus on 4 things to achieve our goal:</p>

<h2 id="interactive-sessions-of-tools-technologies">Interactive sessions of tools/technologies</h2>

<p>This is where we&rsquo;ve observed most success. We have had 4 sessions in past 2
months (we do two-week sprints), with following primary topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Up your ops game: Ansible and Vagrant <em>(delivered by <strong>Charanjit Singh
(me)</strong>)</em></li>
<li>Up your ops game: Docker and Docker Compose <em>(delivered by <strong>Charanjit Singh
(me)</strong></em></li>
<li>Quick and Dirty Kafka <em>(collaboratively delivered by <strong>Charanjit Singh (me),
Rupinder Singh, Sheenam Narula, Krishan Saini</strong>)</em></li>
<li>Getting acquainted with Elasticsearch <em>(delivered by <strong>Krishan Saini</strong>)</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="collaboratively-studying-open-source-projects-we-use">Collaboratively studying open source projects we use</h2>

<p>We started off with <code>chai.js</code>, but after probably spending only a few minutes
each, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13dko42FS9kcnpqnrjp9QCouQO0vZHDQ0tslID3BAQBs/edit?usp=sharing">google doc</a> we created for collaboratively creating notes didn&rsquo;t see
much action.</p>

<h2 id="being-active-in-trantor-forums">Being active in Trantor forums</h2>

<p>Plan was to use Trantor Forums as a platform for proposing (revolutionary)
changes in our project. We started off with <a href="https://forum.trantorinc.com/t/suggested-improvements-for-tdd-in-veriown-cloud-mutation-testing-and-running-tests-concurrently/74">a proposal to introduce mutation
testing</a> in our test-coverage reports, but didn&rsquo;t move forward from that.</p>

<p>I believe this is because we don&rsquo;t really spend as much time exploring
new/different things/subject-matters to be able to bring more of such proposals.
This problem is one of many that should fix itself if we are successful in
fostering a culture of self growth in the team.</p>

<h2 id="day-long-hackathons">Day long hackathons</h2>

<p>We are yet to realize this dream. Shiva proposed a neat little idea to solve a
problem faced by Trantor employees, but turned out an official solution was
already in the works and about to be released in couple weeks (it didn&rsquo;t). I
believe we should have just gone ahead and spend a day to build what we wanted,
just for the heck of it. That would have been more fruitful.</p>

<hr />

<p>Above points are more than just steps to achieve our goal, I believe, they are
also metrics of our success. How much engagement each of these get reflects on
how much of a self-growth culture is prospering in the team. I wonder if we can
somehow quantize these per-person. If nothing else, that&rsquo;ll create some cool
graphs to gawk at.</p>
