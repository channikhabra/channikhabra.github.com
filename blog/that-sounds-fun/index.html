    <p>I got an opportunity to introspect in a conversation with a client when he
questioned my use of the word &ldquo;fun&rdquo;. What do I mean when I say something is fun?
I am not entirely sure. May be when I see something that excites me a little.
People have very different interpretations of fun. For me it is usually applying
creativity to build something. Activities the involve combination of these two,
make me feel most satisfied. Balance is very important.</p>

<p>But what do I really mean when I say something is fun? I almost never know if it
is going to be fulfilling at the time of making this declaration. So how do I
reach the point where I can say that X is going to be fun?</p>

<p>It might be is the opportunity to learn something new. The unknown scares me.
It&rsquo;s a thrill and possibly vain feeling of growth. I have a long list of things
I want to learn/master. When my mind sees an opportunity to check a box off of
that list it gets excited.</p>

<p>It might as well be pure vanity. Vanity plays important part in my mind. When my
subconscious thinks keeping appearances is important, seeing a geeky-sounding
statement just automatically make it blabber &ldquo;that sounds fun&rdquo;. Although I try
to keep my narcissism in check, occasional slips are a thing.</p>

<p>Another thing that I think I consider fun is &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; something. It is quite
possible to mark me as a control freak; although I won&rsquo;t voluntarily accept in a
normal setting. I do however occasionally attain rather strong opinions about
how certain things shall be. When I see an opportunity to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; something to my
definition of right, that is a strong motivational force. However unreliable it
might be, working with motivation is fun.</p>
