<p>I thought out hard last night and came up with a system that might (or might
not) work. But I have to keep trying till I get it right. Here are some main
points of my new system:</p>

<h2 id="1-commitment">#1 Commitment</h2>

<p>Do 8+ hours on day’s priority #1 before you can open any other website/video on
the web. On weekdays it should be work that pay my bills, on weekends it can be
2 things, study/side-kick-projects to try new things/or whatever. I am free to
just troll around on weekends, i.e do nothing and waste the day. This is the
only commitment I make for a day.</p>

<h2 id="2-iterate">#2 Iterate</h2>

<p>Iterate over 3 days. Do above for 3 days, then review it and come up with a list
of things that were tempting me to divert from my plan. Then replace these
things with something else, or if possible get rid of them. Improvise and bring
changes in my system to remove all the falsities. Also make a list of all the
things that were motivating, and keep bringing them back in the system with #3.</p>

<h2 id="3-change">#3 Change</h2>

<p>Bring something new in my workflow every 3 days. Start using some new tool, make
some modifications in Emacs.d, anything. If can’t find anything, spin something
from good things I got from #2 and bring it in the system with a flavour, or
find a creative solution to get rid of something bad from #2</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>It’s not a perfect system, but aiming for perfection has brought nothing but
failure for me in past. I am trying to strike a balance b/w practicality and
flexibility in the system. i.e for a system that would be flexible enough to
improvise over time but strict enough that I won’t get lost in managing the
system itself. Idea is that I am going to get bored from this system in 15 days
max. So before that happens, it should become self-sustaining and would require
minimum input, while giving maximum satisfaction.</p>

<p>This is a system that should create another system when it dies in next 15 days,
and same should happen after than. Only constant is change. Keep improving, and
more importantly, keep changing. Even if it is a step in wrong direction once in
a while, just change for the sake of changing. If my system doesn’t change, I
will abandon it; so no matter how much good it was, it’s gonna get wasted. If it
doesn’t change that is. Change is life baby!</p>

<p>By the way, today was the first day of me using this system. I introduced Trello
as a change to my workflow. I used to plan things in org-mode in my Emacs, it’s
awesome. I changed to Trello just for the sake of changing, and it worked
wonders for one day at least. I believe it can keep doing so for two more days.
After that, I’ll change something else. Not necessarily my thought/todo
management system, but anything. I’ll come back to Emacs’ org-mode some time
later. Constant change doesn’t mean things can’t repeat. Future is what if not a
reincarnation of past.</p>

<p>I did more tasks than I planned for today. It feels good.</p>
