<p>Written below are some opinions and rationalizations for them. I have come to these opinions by interviewing and working with people for years. However strongly I feel about them, they can still be wrong. If you have feedback for these, please do contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/channikhabra/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/channikhabra">Twitter</a>. All kind of feedback is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>From “Functional programmer” I mean a programmer familiar with concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>.</p>
<p>A good teammate is someone:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Who takes care of themselves</strong>. They invest in themselves. They care about their software as a craft, as something more than just cramming a whole bunch of frameworks and libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Who take care of their teammates</strong>.
<ul>
<li>They help their teammates grow, by mentoring and/or by serving as an example</li>
<li>They are empathetic towards other developers. This is most visible in kind of code a person writes. An empathetic developer writes code for other people.
<ul>
<li>They give preference to readability of code over micro-optimizations that make them feel clever</li>
<li>They write modular code with independent modules each of which do one thing well. And are easily composed to build more complex functionality.</li>
<li>They write clean, predictable and intuitive APIs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>FP is steadily gaining popularity, but it is still not popular enough to breach the talent pool I get to interview from. Familiarity with FP is a very good indication that the person invest in themselves. And they do that in a manner which goes beyond just increasing the number of “frameworks” they have built a Todo App in.</p>
<p>Developer empathy is surprisingly rare. In almost a decade of writing code, I have met so few developers who really give a fuck that someone else will also read their abomination. Most software is written in vacuum. Familiarity with FP don’t fix that magically.</p>
<p>However there is another factor at play here. Ironically, as a side-effect of FP, code written in a functional manner is often a lot more readable than its imperative and OOP equivalents (Impromptu quiz: What’s so ironic about this statement?). Not only is functional code itself naturally declarative, an FP person is more likely to wtf when they see unreadable code in PR reviews.</p>
<p>Basic principles of FP also make for great advice for inexperienced developers. Good software architecture is hard to learn, it is a lot harder to teach. You need a mind capable of holding large amounts of complex code before the fancy design patterns even start making sense. In comparison, “pure functions + composition” and you are good to go. That is it. That is all you need to know to get started with writing modular, testable, simple code; which is easy to write and easier to maintain. As a mere side effect of avoiding side effects, you write naturally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> (in spirit) code.</p>
<p>FP is not a silver bullet, but looking for functional programmers skew the universe in your favor a little. You are a lot more likely to get good people among functional programmers.</p>
