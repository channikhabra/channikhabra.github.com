<p>Tech scene in my city (Chandigarh) is daunting. There is super heavy
exploitation of new developers and nobody seem to have any problem with it. In
this post I am plotting the situation from my view, and sharing the reasons
behind my decision of accepting a job where I’ll obviously get exploited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a long time, I’ve been very afraid of doing a job in my locality. First of
my concerns have been that it will hinder my growth. From people working in
local companies, I’ve heard things like “they will suck all plasma out of your
blood; you’ll hate to even look at a computer”. I don’t want this to happen with
me. I love computers, and I want to keep loving computers. I don’t want to get
stuck either. On job, I’ll most likely be doing PHP projects. I don’t want to do
PHP for rest of my life. It was the second language I learned, and I hate it.
Looking back at it after a year of Python, most of it look like mumble-jumble of
hoola-boo.</p>

<p>I will be working 48 hours a week (excluding break; mon-sat 10 am to 7 pm) for
less than $100 per month. Pick that jaw up, I know it’s exploitation. What they
are going to do is get projects from oDesk and similar sites, and make
developers do them, and pay like 0.01% to the devs. I can do it myself sitting
at home, I’ve done a couple projects, but it was not fun. I got bored and left
my third project halfway. I am so fucking undisciplined that it frustrates even
me. Here’s the list of my reasons for diving into the situation which at the
moment looks like a whirlpool to hell.</p>

<h2 id="my-reasons-for-doing-this-job">My reasons for doing this job</h2>

<h3 id="indiscipline">Indiscipline</h3>

<p>I am sick of my fickleness. I get bored like after 20 minutes of playing with
anything. I’ve tried as many techniques as I could in 2 years to discipline
myself. I am expecting my new job to discipline me more. I am expecting it to be
one of the most suffocating environments I can imagine as a developer. I know
the culture of most companies in my city. I’ll have to keep my phone outside the
office before I enter, only the time I spend in my cube will be counted as my
‘in office’ time and similar. If nothing else, it will at least make me realize
the significance of all the freedom I have in my room.</p>

<h3 id="team">Team</h3>

<p>I want a team of coders to work with. I’ve always done coding alone, and I am
sick of it. It’s no fun. I want to work in a team. I want to show off my work.
And most importantly I want smart people around me to look upto and learn from.
There will probably be senior developers on job from whom I can learn many
things.</p>

<h3 id="network">Network</h3>

<p>I’ve been living in the place I am staying at present for about 8 months, and my
neighbor doesn’t know I live in this house. Actually I met my neighbor in the
new company I joined when I went there for interview. He work there. He
accidentally read the address on my resume and asked me. I wasn’t least bit
surprised when he said “I didn’t know you live there, I thought there’s only an
old couple in that house”. I have made literally 0 friends in the period of 8
months, and I hardly know more than 5 people in whole city (that old couple
included). I am expecting to get to know more people from programming community.
And may be I’ll make some friends.</p>

<h3 id="i-want-these-9-months-to-change-my-life">I want these 9 months to change my life</h3>

<p>I will be doing a bond of 9 months with them. If I leave them before 9 months, I
will be paying them my 2 month salary before leaving. I want these 9 months to
change my life. I don’t mind working heavily underpaid if I can grow myself in
same proportions as the exploitation. I will be working in a technology I’ve
always hated, more because of other’s opinions than my own experience. From this
I am expecting to learn something I haven’t realized yet.</p>

<p>I want them to stand with a machine gun and shoot whatever they can at me. I am
expecting to gain a lot of mental strength and sharpen my ability to quickly
learn new things further. I’ve always felt proud of my quick-learning ability, I
want to put it through the most intense test.</p>

<h3 id="confidence">Confidence</h3>

<p>I know many things. I’ve developed things in Django, Flask, PyQt, CodeIgniter,
SlimPHP, Wordpress, Angularjs, ReactJs, Backbone and similar tools. But still I
could never collect enough nerve to bid for any such projects on freelancing
sites. I know I can do them, I do them for my friends or for my experiments, but
I get scared when it comes to work for someone I don’t know. On the job I’ll be
forced to do things. May be by doing things this way I’ll get some confidence.</p>

<h3 id="i-want-to-study-the-environment">I want to study the environment</h3>

<p>This is the last thing on my mind, actually at the moment it is not even on my
mind. I am too scared thinking of what is about to come. But earlier it was one
my reasons for my decision of jumping in.</p>

<p>Things are very bad in my city. There is no any kind of active community of
computer enthusiasts; be it some Linux Users Group or something similar. For me
thinking Hackathons in my city is similar to thinking a Lamborghini in my
garage. Developers are heavily underpaid and over-exploited. I want to study the
environment. I have ideas for a self-sustaining software company that would
follow an open business model (another idea in my ideas.org). I want to foresee
if it is practical.</p>

<h2 id="thing-that-triggered-this-decision">Thing that triggered this decision</h2>

<p>I have been at home for about 2 months, self-learning stuff. I thought of
continuing like this for next 4 months. Couple days back I met Jayant on
/r/machinelearning. (We’ve decided to pursue learning ml the way I discussed in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814135355/http://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1y9t11/is%5Fit%5Fa%5Fgood%5Fapproach%5Fto%5Fget%5Fstarted%5Fwith%5Fmachine/">this thread</a>. If you are interested in joining the team pm me.) I talked to him
and he turned out to be in a situation very similar to mine. He even called us
identical twins. But he’s a year ahead of me. He spent a whole year
self-learning without doing any job. He said the experience was good and he
learned a lot. I had a different feeling from his words though. Assuming that we
are identical, I want to know what would have happened if he made the other
choice. So I have decided to go for “learning on the shitty job” approach, just
to make a twist in the timeline. It’s looking like a risky decision to me, so I
was postponing it for some time. But the thrill of doing this experiment is what
triggered me doing it. Life is an experiment after all, and I like doing crazy
things with it.</p>
