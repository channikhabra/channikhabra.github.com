<p>The wave I am talking about here is the period of crests and troughs which I
have been experiencing for like always. It has always been a very commoving
pull-back experience. Lately I have been through a series of change and started
looking at things with a different eye. Here’s a list of things helping me the
most.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My life is like riding a wave. When I am on the crest everything is easy, I am
super-curious, confident and over-flowing with energy. After some time the
energy of the crest goes away. And starts very depressing, negative period. I
feel myself to be a weight on Earth. People call them `burn-outs’. I have read
they burn-out after doing something reckless. But I burn-out periodically. This
very negative time come in circles in my life no matter what I do.</p>

<p>But now I think I’ve eventually managed to leverage my wave. I am not just
living with it, I am using it. I started looking at the world with a different
view after I read the Theory of Positive Disintegration. I learned it’s not bad
to be super-sensitive. The sadness, the pain, they can be used for good.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things helping me to make something out of all the mess my
life have become, and utilize the wave.</p>

<h2 id="abandoned-commitments-and-my-gtd-dot-org">Abandoned commitments and my gtd.org</h2>

<p>I once tried to utilize the `Getting Things Done’ system. It didn’t work very
well for me. Although it did not fail 100% either. Thanks to it now I am in a
habit of writing down most of my thoughts (I do it in an org file I’ve named
gtd.org). I have made a list of all the commitments I have made to myself,
things I wanted to do but didn’t, and things I want to do in future. All the
fallen dreams/commitments which have been a psychological weight on me. One of
the problems I face in troughs is that I find nothing interesting. Like I don’t
want anything. Reading through my gtd.org always give me something in which some
part of me is interested. I haven’t recognized any pattern in this yet, but it
significantly decreases the trough period. Last time I found learning e-lisp
quite fascinating and that brought me out of the trough fast, and my crest now
is not that chaotic.</p>

<h2 id="inspiration-from-the-100-day-goals">Inspiration from the `<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119093711/http://channikhabra.github.io/2013/10/20/I-eventually-managed-to-leverage-my-wave/blog.42floors.com/100-day-goals/">100 day goals</a>’</h2>

<p>I read a blog post in which an entrepreneur is talking about his system of
applying ‘100 day limits’ to do some hard projects. He also warned that he and
his team get burnt out and need rest after that. I thought to myself that I am
going to burn out anyways, there is no stopping to it, so why not give it a
shot. May be it will do some good. And it is working. I set a limit to finish
`The Emacs-lisp intro’ in seven days, and did it. It felt good. The sense of
achievement was much needed.</p>

<h2 id="self-introspection">Self introspection</h2>

<p>To me self introspection appear to be a wastage of time on crests. But it has
been a great help in darkest depths of my troughs. Would it be studying
psychology, trying to diagnose myself for some mental disorder, or just digging
through my zodiac and stuff, it help me not get lost. It’s like the last line of
defense for my focus, and has always worked till now. It give me a feel that all
the chaos can be sorted out.</p>

<h2 id="video-games">Video games</h2>

<p>They have always been a source of despair actually. I waste all my time in them
when I am going through troughs. But I actually found a way to utilize them. It
came from another blog post I read. What I was doing was that I used to play a
lot of video games in troughs, and none at all in crests. May be it created a
pulling force towards troughs. Inspired by above mentioned blog post, I now give
a little time playing some games everyday. And I am riding on my longest crest
ever.</p>

<h2 id="a-pinch-of-success">A pinch of success</h2>

<p>I used to love my computer more than I love my girlfriend (note: my culture has
molded my mind to make me a serious one woman man, don’t interpret the word
‘girlfriend’ as used in western-culture relationships). I still feel fascinated
about computers and programming, but looking at my computer I have a feeling
like a lost battle-ground. There are so many things I thought I could do with
it, so many I started on it, and no one I ever finished. The wave is the one I
blame.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119093711/http://channikhabra.github.io/2013/10/11/the-most-beautiful-tutorial/">My previous blog post</a> was a wild success (when seen from my eyes). It earned me
many hn and reddit points, and is still bringing traffic. It was a blow to my
thought that I can’t achieve anything. Many of the self-doubting thoughts that
started raising heads in my head got chopped.</p>

<p>I took a lesson from it. Instead of trying to pursue my half-baked
world-changing ideas, I will spend more time doing small things. It certainly
doesn’t mean I am not thinking big. I still have ideas that will turn the world
around ;-) But a pinch of success is necessary.</p>
