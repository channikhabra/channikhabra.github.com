<p>I am thinking about doing a small series of posts on how I am managing the chaos
that I am trying to stop fighting. I hope the chaos of an ADHD mind can be
utilized rather than fought against. So far it has been working out pretty great
(for past ~8 months). This post is about how I manage my ever exploding list of
things I want to do.</p>

<p>I believe one of the most important things is to externalize your thoughts.
Making it a habit to write them down is immensely helpful. So many of my
problems stopped being problems as I adopted writing things down more and more.
I have very small working memory. I forget often and I forget most things. Mind
is always thinking of new ideas, things to do, things to tell people. The
knowledge that I am going to forget the thing I am thinking right now is
a big source of anxiety. The burden of remembering innumerable things and then
failing to do so has a cognitive toll of its own.</p>

<p>I use org-mode as a lot of things; a TODO list is one of them. I am not going to
get into the details of using org-mode for a beginner, but I&rsquo;ll share my flow of
using org mode as a TODO list.</p>

<h2 id="capturing-things-to-do">Capturing things to do</h2>

<p>A very useful feature of org-mode is how easy it makes to &ldquo;capture&rdquo; TOOD items.
I use Emacs as my primary text editor; being a software developer, most of my
day time is spent in Emacs. Any time I think of something I [want|have] to do, I
capture it with 3 keystrokes and usually immediately refile it under an
appropriate heading. I keep 2 TODOs.org files, one for work and one for my
personal life.</p>

<p>In my personal TODOs.org file, I keep headings categorizing the kind of thing it
is that I want to do; right now, they are =Study, Personal Development, Habits,
Projects, Reading List, In Basket&rdquo;. &ldquo;In Basket&rdquo; heading keeps things that are
quickly done in a day or few, and/or cannot be categorized.</p>

<p>My work TODOs.org carries all my work related tasks, including Jira issues, and
general things I want/have to do when I am in the office. I have a TODO item to
integrate org-jira, but right now I am manually copying Jira task IDs around
like an imbecile.</p>

<p>This is how my org-capture-templates variable looks like right now:</p>

<pre><code class="language-elisp">(setq
   org-capture-templates
   '((&quot;d&quot; &quot;Diary Entry&quot; plain (file+datetree org-agenda-diary-file) &quot;\n&lt;%&lt;%I:%M %p&gt;&gt;\n%?\n&quot;)
     (&quot;f&quot; &quot;Feedback&quot; plain (file+datetree trantor-feedback-file) &quot;\n&lt;%&lt;%I:%M %p&gt;&gt;\n%?\n&quot;)
     (&quot;i&quot; &quot;Idea&quot; entry (file org-ideas-file) &quot;* %?\n%T&quot;)
     (&quot;t&quot; &quot;Todo&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;&quot; &quot;Todos&quot;) &quot;* TODO %?\n%U\n[[%F]]&quot;)
     (&quot;c&quot; &quot;Contact&quot; entry (file org-contacts-file) &quot;* %^{Name}\n:PROPERTIES:\n:COMPANY %^{Company}\n:PHONE: %^{Phone}\n:END:&quot;)))
</code></pre>

<h2 id="delegating-things-to-future">Delegating things to future</h2>

<p>Org-mode has a brilliant feature of scheduling tasks. It&rsquo;s rare for me to
schedule a task for &ldquo;today&rdquo;; I delegate stuff to future me. I can capture and
file things in any header, and then use org-mode&rsquo;s agenda views to filter out
things past-me assigned for today. I try to finish the &ldquo;today&rdquo; tasks, and try to
stay at peace when I fail to every day. Org-mode also display a count of for how
long I&rsquo;ve been missing to do a certain task which is a handy reminder that I am
falling short on my commitments.</p>

<h2 id="prioritizing-things">Prioritizing things</h2>

<p>Not all tasks are made equal. Although I try my best to not let my &ldquo;Today&rdquo; tasks
list become too big, sometimes there is simply too much on the plate. In that
case, I define priorities for the most important tasks, which are displayed at
the top of the list in Day-agenda view.</p>

<h2 id="tagging-items">Tagging items</h2>

<p>I often tag my TODO items so I can easily filter them in the agenda view when I
want to find things I have to do in some particular context. I often tag things by:</p>

<ul>
<li>The person&rsquo;s name who I need to be with for doing something e.g when I want to
tell someone something</li>
<li>The Scrum sprint in which a task need to get done. For this I don&rsquo;t tag each
task but instead file my tasks in a &ldquo;Sprint X&rdquo; heading which is tagged, and
org-mode automatically inherit tags to all the subheadings</li>
<li>Place where I need to be at for doing something</li>
<li>Some other task specific metadata that I think can be helpful for finding this
task</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="finding-things-to-do">Finding things to do</h2>

<p>Org-mode allow me to write my todo items in any order in any manner; I have
several files where I write a lot of stuff, some of it is things to do; most if
it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s crucial to write things down for me, because I know that I am
going to forget it. Org-mode is immensely helpful in finding things out when I
need it. Org-files being just text files allow me to just grep stuff; which is
even more powerful with helm-projectile-grep. But the killer feature for finding
out what I am supposed to be doing right now is org&rsquo;s agenda view. It allow me
to filter things by time and tags.</p>

<p>Org-mode require you to explicitly add files to a list of <code>org-agenda-files</code>.
The agenda views only pick tasks from files in this list. I have almost all my
org files in my agenda list. It also provides different views for the agenda;
the one I am using most these days is the &ldquo;Day-agenda&rdquo; view, and Week-agenda
view when I want to plan things ahead for the week.</p>

<p>On my mobile, I use orgzly android app. I am not too happy with it, but it&rsquo;s the
best I&rsquo;ve got for now. I&rsquo;ve it in my TODO list to create an app focused on
org-mode and TODO lists the way I want it to work.</p>
