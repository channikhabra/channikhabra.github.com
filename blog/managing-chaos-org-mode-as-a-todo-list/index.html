<article class="main-article">
  <p>I am thinking about doing a small series of posts on how I am managing the chaos that I am trying to stop fighting. I hope the chaos of an ADHD mind can be utilized rather than fought against. So far it has been working out pretty great (for past ~8 months). This post is about how I manage my ever exploding list of things I want to do.</p>
<p>I believe one of the most important things is to externalize your thoughts. Making it a habit to write them down is immensely helpful. So many of my problems stopped being problems as I adopted writing things down more and more. I have very small working memory. I forget often and I forget most things. Mind is always thinking of new ideas, things to do, things to tell people. The knowledge that I am going to forget the thing I am thinking right now is a big source of anxiety. The burden of remembering innumerable things and then failing to do so has a cognitive toll of its own.</p>
<p>I use org-mode as a lot of things; a TODO list is one of them. I am not going to get into the details of using org-mode for a beginner, but I’ll share my flow of using org mode as a TODO list.</p>
<h2 id="capturing-things-to-do">Capturing things to do</h2>
<p>A very useful feature of org-mode is how easy it makes to “capture” TOOD items. I use Emacs as my primary text editor; being a software developer, most of my day time is spent in Emacs. Any time I think of something I [want|have] to do, I capture it with 3 keystrokes and usually immediately refile it under an appropriate heading. I keep 2 TODOs.org files, one for work and one for my personal life.</p>
<p>In my personal TODOs.org file, I keep headings categorizing the kind of thing it is that I want to do; right now, they are =Study, Personal Development, Habits, Projects, Reading List, In Basket“.”In Basket" heading keeps things that are quickly done in a day or few, and/or cannot be categorized.</p>
<p>My work TODOs.org carries all my work related tasks, including Jira issues, and general things I want/have to do when I am in the office. I have a TODO item to integrate org-jira, but right now I am manually copying Jira task IDs around like an imbecile.</p>
<p>This is how my org-capture-templates variable looks like right now:</p>
<pre class="elisp"><code>(setq
   org-capture-templates
   '((&quot;d&quot; &quot;Diary Entry&quot; plain (file+datetree org-agenda-diary-file) &quot;\n&lt;%&lt;%I:%M %p&gt;&gt;\n%?\n&quot;)
     (&quot;f&quot; &quot;Feedback&quot; plain (file+datetree trantor-feedback-file) &quot;\n&lt;%&lt;%I:%M %p&gt;&gt;\n%?\n&quot;)
     (&quot;i&quot; &quot;Idea&quot; entry (file org-ideas-file) &quot;* %?\n%T&quot;)
     (&quot;t&quot; &quot;Todo&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;&quot; &quot;Todos&quot;) &quot;* TODO %?\n%U\n[[%F]]&quot;)
     (&quot;c&quot; &quot;Contact&quot; entry (file org-contacts-file) &quot;* %^{Name}\n:PROPERTIES:\n:COMPANY %^{Company}\n:PHONE: %^{Phone}\n:END:&quot;)))</code></pre>
<h2 id="delegating-things-to-future">Delegating things to future</h2>
<p>Org-mode has a brilliant feature of scheduling tasks. It’s rare for me to schedule a task for “today”; I delegate stuff to future me. I can capture and file things in any header, and then use org-mode’s agenda views to filter out things past-me assigned for today. I try to finish the “today” tasks, and try to stay at peace when I fail to every day. Org-mode also display a count of for how long I’ve been missing to do a certain task which is a handy reminder that I am falling short on my commitments.</p>
<h2 id="prioritizing-things">Prioritizing things</h2>
<p>Not all tasks are made equal. Although I try my best to not let my “Today” tasks list become too big, sometimes there is simply too much on the plate. In that case, I define priorities for the most important tasks, which are displayed at the top of the list in Day-agenda view.</p>
<h2 id="tagging-items">Tagging items</h2>
<p>I often tag my TODO items so I can easily filter them in the agenda view when I want to find things I have to do in some particular context. I often tag things by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person’s name who I need to be with for doing something e.g when I want to tell someone something</li>
<li>The Scrum sprint in which a task need to get done. For this I don’t tag each task but instead file my tasks in a “Sprint X” heading which is tagged, and org-mode automatically inherit tags to all the subheadings</li>
<li>Place where I need to be at for doing something</li>
<li>Some other task specific metadata that I think can be helpful for finding this task</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finding-things-to-do">Finding things to do</h2>
<p>Org-mode allow me to write my todo items in any order in any manner; I have several files where I write a lot of stuff, some of it is things to do; most if it isn’t. It’s crucial to write things down for me, because I know that I am going to forget it. Org-mode is immensely helpful in finding things out when I need it. Org-files being just text files allow me to just grep stuff; which is even more powerful with helm-projectile-grep. But the killer feature for finding out what I am supposed to be doing right now is org’s agenda view. It allow me to filter things by time and tags.</p>
<p>Org-mode require you to explicitly add files to a list of <code>org-agenda-files</code>. The agenda views only pick tasks from files in this list. I have almost all my org files in my agenda list. It also provides different views for the agenda; the one I am using most these days is the “Day-agenda” view, and Week-agenda view when I want to plan things ahead for the week.</p>
<p>On my mobile, I use orgzly android app. I am not too happy with it, but it’s the best I’ve got for now. I’ve it in my TODO list to create an app focused on org-mode and TODO lists the way I want it to work.</p>
