<p>It is one of those rare times I decide to write a blog post without life taking
a huge shit on me. Or am I just projecting success for attracting success? Guess
bitches. Hope you&rsquo;re all living in reality and not losing yourself in your
imaginary fantasy world. Guess what? You&rsquo;re not living in reality. There is no
reality to live in.</p>

<p>Reality like God can not be seen, observed, or proven. Even those fucking
scientists giving hardcore &ldquo;laws&rdquo; of physics say there can be other realities
where our laws of physics don&rsquo;t apply. Hell they don&rsquo;t apply everywhere in our
own dimension (hint: Quantum of Solace was a douchie movie ).</p>

<p>Even if there is a <strong>reality</strong> (emphasis not mine, don&rsquo;t know who did it) to
observe and live in, human mind (and eyes) are certainly out of their league to
observe it for what it is. Fuck we can&rsquo;t even understand what the person in
front of us is saying, we only understand what we hear.</p>

<h2 id="personal-realities">Personal Realities</h2>

<p>We all live in our own versions of personal realities, sort of like bubbles all
our lives and thoughts and even imaginations are trapped in. Reality is that we
can&rsquo;t know the reality. We&rsquo;ll always live in one bubble or other. Best you can
do is choose your bubble, and switch from time to time. More bubbles you
observe, better your chances are to not get locked in one.</p>

<p>Everyone is living in a bubble. Some are aware of it, most are not. People see
through lenses they wear over time. With time the lenses get different shades,
get thicker and thicker. At the end of it, your whole life is a fucking opinion.</p>

<p>People in fact, live in more than one bubbles. Bubble of &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; given by your
parents, religion and society, the &ldquo;professional&rdquo; bubble most get caught in when
they taste the thing they think is success for first time (this one is easiest
to detect, look around, ask people why they&rsquo;re doing what they&rsquo;re doing), the
&ldquo;love&rdquo; bubble you get trapped in from movies and fairy tales, and many more.</p>

<h2 id="probabilities">Probabilities</h2>

<p>You have no control over your life. Life is not yours to control, it is not
real. Everyone around you is carrying their own reality, overlapping and
interfering with yours. Best chance you&rsquo;ve got is a chance. If you want to make
something happen, you can only increase its probability of happening. Doesn&rsquo;t
mean you should lose hope and go home (if you thought that, you probably should
give up and go home), if you wanna make something happen, you gotta keep
increasing the probability of its occurrence until the probability is 1. Or
spend your 80 years of misery trying to do so.</p>

<h2 id="people">People</h2>

<p>When I see people around, I try to think of them as different realities. Every
single one of them is living in their own reality. You&rsquo;d be surprised to find
out how easy it is to manipulate someone (read bend people to your will) once
you can empathise with their reality.</p>

<p>The only way to observe a (wo)man&rsquo;s reality is to observe it from the outside.
Like I said, it is not the reality, it is a bubble. Most people are hardcoded in
their bubbles. Bubbles are like games (or is it my bubble kicking in?), bubbles
have rules too. Like every game has its own rules of physics, bubbles have their
own rules. Even if you can&rsquo;t live another person&rsquo;s bubble, you can read their
rules. If you can do it well enough, you can tell exactly what other person is
thinking and what he&rsquo;s going to do in next 5 minutes, or 5 years.</p>

<p>You know the couples which live together (happily) can communicate without
talking, can tell what&rsquo;s up in other person&rsquo;s mind. My theory is that by being
close for long enough time, their bubbles start overlapping. Like Van diagrams,
there is that area in which they think exactly same things. They don&rsquo;t need
words anymore to communicate, because they know what other person is feeling
(and hence thinking, wanting to say or do or whatever, old people creep me out).</p>

<h2 id="reading-the-bubbles">Reading the bubbles</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not confined to couples, neither you need to live with someone for a
lifetime to be able to observe their bubbles. It is a skill, an art perhaps.
Some people are damn good at it.</p>

<p>It is easy to observe others&rsquo; bubbles. The basic and most difficult requirement
is already met. You are already outside the bubble, now all you have to do is
study it from inside without entering it. Easy, huh? Look for the reflections.
Make them talk, don&rsquo;t listen to what they say, look for the patterns. Patterns
tell you the rules of their worlds. Try to imagine how it is to see through
those eyes. That is a whole different world that person is seeing, it is,
fascinating to say the least. (Fuck I just told you my mind reading trick, I
think I should stop blogging)</p>

<p>You need the right set of tools to think in. Like in software it&rsquo;s all about the
right abstractions. This whole &ldquo;bubbles&rdquo; thing is just that, a tool to think in.
Ultimate goal is to be able to look at the world exactly as someone else, find
out the patterns, and hence the rules. And of course ultimately play the rules
for fun and profit.</p>

<p>Or you can take the script-kiddie way and jump to finding rules, skipping the
hardest first part. But that route involves lot of trial and error, failure may
result in bitter relations for life. Plus, you lose all the scope for creativity
and flexibility when you take the latter way.</p>

<h2 id="business">Business</h2>

<p>These &ldquo;personal realities&rdquo; can (and are) actually be used for manipulating
people to do what you want.</p>

<p>People live in many bubbles; many people live in similar bubbles. Bubbles have
rules, similar bubbles have similar rules. The textbook tricks salespeople do
lie in that domain. The whole range of tricks an Indian sales person use
everyday, won&rsquo;t work if he move shop to US. The whole mutual reality his
customers live in just changed. (There are of course certain universal rules
which work with almost all humans. How many years of evolution was it again?)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s rudimentary though. <strong>Personal realities</strong> can actually be created. You are
a sales guy, imagine if you could create a world where people think they need
your towels although they don&rsquo;t ever bath or wash their hands (nasty people, I
like &lsquo;em already). You can do that for one person at a time, or N people at a
time where N is the number of people who watch the news you control, or (be less
dramatic) people who watch your advertisements. Again there are different levels
of sophistication with which this can be done. More you know about someone
(that&rsquo;s why you make &lsquo;em talk), their habits etc, easier it is to manipulate and
fabricate entirely new realities for them. Imagine how fun the life would be if
you were Facebook or Google. I&rsquo;ve heard Facebook knows even when and how many
times you go to poop everyday.</p>

<p>You didn&rsquo;t think I was all evil trying to teach you how to manipulate people as
I do, did you? Well that&rsquo;s certainly a perk, but the goal is to be able to
identify the realities from induced realities, and fabricated realities (there&rsquo;s
a difference). See I was trying to save you all this time, you silly! I am no
evil! Come on now jump in my van already, I have tinfoil hats too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll probably talk about this in depth later some time, about the different
tools I&rsquo;ve figured people using, some unused ones I&rsquo;ve discovered through
experimentation, and other delusional shit.</p>

<p>I could write a book about it, but I gotta go watch that movie everyone on
Reddit has started talking about all of a sudden.</p>
