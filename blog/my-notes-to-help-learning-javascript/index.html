<h2 id="patience">Patience</h2>

<p>You need to keep it. Don&rsquo;t rush, it&rsquo;s alright if you are not getting it.
Specially if you are from Python world. Javascript is to Python like India is to
New Zeland, things are not actually as complicated as they appear, you just need
to keep little patience.</p>

<h2 id="coffeescript-is-your-friend">Coffeescript is your friend</h2>

<p>Coffeescript helped me learn to think in javascript more than any book. I am not
saying that you should use coffeescript, but use it for learning more about
javascript. If you are unable to think something in javascript, do a version of
it in Coffeescript, generate javascript and try to learn. I don&rsquo;t know how good
is the generated javascript, but it was good enough for me to not get stuck.
Emacs helped me a lot in this. I created a buffer with coffee-mode which was not
visiting any file, and compiled coffee to see javascript in a split window for
comparison. It really helped to avoid creating temporary files.</p>

<h2 id="don-t-rely-too-much-on-books-try-something-real">Don&rsquo;t rely too much on books, try something real</h2>

<p>Books can do only so much to help you. Elequent Javascript is great (or so they
call it, actually I never got why it&rsquo;s called great), but what a real project
can teach you is on another level. Go out in wild and try to do some real
project, for fun of course.</p>

<h2 id="avoid-dom-and-ui">Avoid DOM and UI</h2>

<p>DOM manipulation and Javascript have their own concepts which are most times
confusing to foreigners, specially if you are already infected by JQuery. Make
your aim to learn Javascript, as a programming language and do something you do
when learning a new language. Make self-contained scripts which don&rsquo;t need
browser to work. Of course browser help when you are getting started and with
&lsquo;console.log&rsquo; you can avoid all sort of DOM manipulation, but that&rsquo;s not what I
mean. On the next step to getting started, when you &lsquo;think&rsquo; you know some
javascript, try to make something that involve as little DOM manipulation as
possible. Try making some simple nodeJs module, or some sort of browser
extension.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-getting-it-done-learning-is-a-bonus">Focus on getting it done, learning is a bonus</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s better if you choose to do something you want to use, or at least something
you find really interesting. And focus on getting it done. All ninja skills you
want to learn come as a bonus. Remember those old Jackie Chan movies in which
kung-fu master make him do his household chores? Just focus on washing clothes,
you&rsquo;ll learn iron-fist style without knowing it, as a bonus.</p>
