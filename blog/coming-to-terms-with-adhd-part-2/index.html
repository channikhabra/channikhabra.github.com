    <p>One of the important aspects of living with ADHD is getting overwhelmed by
thoughts. This is usually a major pain in the ass. When left unchecked it
usually leads to a lot of confusion very painfully visible to people around you.
This made most of my school life very tormenting. Despite being an &ldquo;A&rdquo; student,
I was always completely lost.</p>

<p>This got better when I found computers. A book I found while sitting in the
wrong classroom turned things around for me. My thoughts got channeled, things
started becoming a lot more clearer when I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of 10 random things
at a time. I was still thinking of 10 things at a time, but it was now
manageable; it was interesting. I wasn&rsquo;t fighting the trains of thought anymore,
I was enjoying the ride.</p>

<p>This was alright while it was fun and games, but it became a problem again when
I entered software development as a profession. Now I had to focus on things for
extended duration of time; which usually was more than my interest span. It was
a struggle again. I got over that period though; my current solution is to bring
more accountability for my work, for which right now, I am doing a day job.</p>

<p>During my period of struggle, I did a lot of fight to stay focused. I fought to
not let distractions come in; I blocked sites, tried several time-boxing
techniques; most things worked, but for a small duration of time. The fight did
me more bad than good. Exploring things is what make me happy, when I took that
away from myself, the frustration that built up as a result threw me in a pit of
despair.</p>

<p>My recommendation to anyone finding [her|him]self in my shoes is to not fight it
all the time. Do whatever you feel like every once in a while. It is very
important to keep feeling happy. Trust yourself that you&rsquo;ll manage to get
important things done in time. However, you need to build/earn this trust. Read
my <a href="https://channikhabra.github.io/blog/coming-to-terms-with-adhd/">previous post</a> for some tips on how I do it.</p>

<p>When you find something you feel passionate about, the multiple trains of
thought kinda all go in the same direction. They&rsquo;re all interesting, and you
want to ride them all. If you fight to ride one (or few) of them, you&rsquo;re gonna
give yourself a hard time. Instinct to hop on each one of them until another one
is more interesting isn&rsquo;t all that evil. I&rsquo;ll be writing more posts on how I do
that (i.e tools and techniques I use), I don&rsquo;t have time right now, and am
losing interest in writing this post. Try to trust yourself that you&rsquo;ll come
back to what you&rsquo;re pausing, have means that allow you to hop b/w different
things, and try to be at peace with the fact that this is simply how you
operate. It might look chaotic to others, you&rsquo;ll still not be &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, but
you&rsquo;ll be a whole lot happy, and hopefully satisfied.</p>

<p>In my current setup I have tens of different things I am time-sharing on, and am
still delivering satisfactory value in my work. It is certainly possible for you
to not fight tooth and nail with your way of thinking and have a satisfactory
career (at least in Software Development).</p>
