<p>I need to reinvent a system for keeping myself in check. I can’t think of a
single thing I haven’t tried in past; pomodoros, gtd, time boxing, what not.
They all work for some time, and then stop working. We find flaws in systems
pretty quickly; we find cracks, make excused to let us do the easiest thing, the
laziest thing.</p>

<p>No matter what system I would adopt next, it all wears off soon. This is a wheel
that has been reinvented countless times. If only world was so simple that what
works for one would work for all. I need to build a system unique for myself;
considering factors that might not have existed for those who predate me. Things
that I didn’t include earlier.</p>

<h2 id="change">Change</h2>

<p>I never considered change to be a part of any of my systems. I should this time.
I believe most things work because of the new tools/techniques/whatever they
bring on plate. A new lifestyle, a new toy, or just a different way to do
something. As soon as the newness fades away, it becomes a chore to do. A
cognitive load that I finally throw away with a deep breath.</p>

<p>I wonder how I’ll integrate change. To make it an ultimate changing system, may
I should adopt the actual digital nomad lifestyle. Travel around all the time. A
month here, few weeks there, keep hopping from city to city. But then, I don’t
think I am a traveler kind of person. I like it more when there is less chaos
outside my mind.</p>

<h2 id="hunger">Hunger</h2>

<p>Another important thing is the hunger for growth. I have an unquenchable thirst
for growing bigger and bigger. Bigger in everything. I am not a competitive
person though, I don’t like competing with others. With just myself. I believe
it is a good thing. Most satisfying is when I grow my skill set, learning
something new or getting deeper into what I am already familiar with. But I
wonder if it should be used as a carrot, or as a central piece of the system.
Using it as carrot would be like having a 2 hour slot to study something after
the day’s work is done. For making it a central piece of the system will require
me to find either:</p>

<ul>
<li>New things to learn from within what I am currently working. Or</li>
<li>Find work for what I want to learn/strengthen</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="race">Race</h2>

<p>I am seeing people leaving me behind, in the race I don’t know I belong or not. A friend just got a job in a startup with very smart people. I envy him for the work environment and team he’ll have there. May be I’ll start looking for a job in May. Or just enter the wilds of freelancing, leaving the mothership of faceyspacey. I don’t know. But that would be an easy workaround, not a solution. I might get into a team of people smarter than me, but not now. Not before I learn to orchestrate this chaos in my head.</p>

<p>These problems have been with me from the very beginning. I thought I solved them when we were in that pressure cooker with celebvidy. They seemed to be a thing of past when we were doing 18 hour days a year ago. But here I am facing them again, half dead. Or living dead may be (the problems, not me). I know I have nailed them, it just need a final push, the last piece of puzzle.</p>

<h2 id="specs">Specs</h2>

<p>I don’t like it when I waste a day like I did today. I need to develop a real good system for myself, a system that will consume least willpower and provide maximum satisfaction.</p>

<h3 id="consumes-willpower">Consumes willpower</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Decision making</p>

<p>What to eat lunch, which cold drink, which snack. Fuck.</p></li>

<li><p>The feeling of “not enough freedom” I have living in the hostel.</p></li>

<li><p>Forcing myself to do things</p>

<ul>
<li>when I actually want to do something else. Oooh new shiny
language/framework, so cool. I wanna do that, and I am stuck with Meteor. I
can code this shit in dreams.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="boosts-willpower">Boosts willpower</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Change in my tools</p>

<p>A new cool mode in Emacs, some new sexy modification I do in settings, some new cool way I invent to do something that was repeating</p></li>

<li><p>Knowing my tools better</p>

<p>Reading something new/deeper about Emacs/git/javascript/meteor is generally a happy/refreshing moment</p></li>

<li><p>Talking to someone new in a friendly way.</p>

<p>If this backfires, it keep me drained for days though.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="maximum-satisfaction">Maximum satisfaction</h3>

<p>Seeing 8:00+ in the hours worked today
Knocking more tasks from my todo list than I actually plan to
Exercising</p>

<p>It is funny all these things that give most satisfaction at the end of the day
are most hard to do.</p>

<p>I am making this a blog post. Will be funny to read in future when I have
conquered all these problems.</p>
